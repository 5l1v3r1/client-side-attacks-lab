# Lab 1: CORS Origin Reflection I

### Background

One of the most serious CORS misconfigurations is reflecting any arbitrary origin into the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` response header.  This is particularly bad when combined with the `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` response header, as it allows an attacker to use the victim's cookies or HTTP Basic auth if the victim is authenticated.
